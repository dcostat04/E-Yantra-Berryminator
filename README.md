# Shape-Color-and-coordinate-detction-using-opencv(Task 1A E-Yantra)

In this program we find the following details for each image in the manner shown below:

Detect all the non-white shapes in the images<br>

Store the details of these detected shapes in a list in the same order as mentioned below:

‘test_image_name’: [‘Color’, ‘Shape’, (cX, cY)]<br>
Example => [‘Red’, ‘Circle’, (588, 370)]<br>

All detected shapes in a single image should be stored as a nested list as shown below:
insert img

‘Color’ => String in single quotation marks, with only the first letter in capital <br>
‘Shape’ => String in single quotation marks, with only the first letter in capital<br>
cX => Int value (centroid coordinate of shape on horizontal X-axis direction)<br>
cY => Int value (centroid coordinate of shape on vertical Y-axis direction)<br>
