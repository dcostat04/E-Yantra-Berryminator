# CoppeliaSim Remote API Interface and QR Code detection(Task 1B E-Yantra)

The objective of this task is to use Python Remote API to interface with CoppeliaSim Robot Simulator and implement QR code detection 
for images returned by a vision sensor in CoppeliaSim. The students are required to write functions that are able to:

*Initiate and Exit Remote API connection with CoppeliaSim
*Start and Stop Simulation in CoppeliaSim
*Retrieve image from vision sensor in CoppeliaSim scene
*Transform image returned from vision sensor into OpenCV format
*Detect QR codes in the transformed vision sensor image
