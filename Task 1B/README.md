# CoppeliaSim Remote API Interface and QR Code detection(Task 1B E-Yantra)

The objective of this task is to use Python Remote API to interface with CoppeliaSim Robot Simulator and implement QR code detection 
for images returned by a vision sensor in CoppeliaSim. The students are required to write functions that are able to:

* Initiate and Exit Remote API connection with CoppeliaSim <br>
* Start and Stop Simulation in CoppeliaSim <br>
* Retrieve image from vision sensor in CoppeliaSim scene <br>
* Transform image returned from vision sensor into OpenCV format <br>
* Detect QR codes in the transformed vision sensor image <br>
